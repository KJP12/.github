# Ampflower's Archive

Hi, I'm [Ampflower](https://github.com), previously known as KJP12, which is likely how you stumbled into here in the
first place.

Here, you'll find some old archived projects that I no longer actively maintain.
Quality in either UX, UI or stability is not guaranteed here, as these projects are old or may link to no longer
existing services.

If you'd like to find some of what I do now, please look at [my current account](https://github.com/Ampflower), there's
more exciting stuff with actively developed projects there.
